# üöÄ Dynamic Content Handling in RecyclerView with EditTexts üìù

Welcome to **Dynamic Content in RecyclerView**! In this project, I've explored and demonstrated how to handle dynamic content such as **EditTexts** in a `RecyclerView`, particularly focusing on how RecyclerView manages **view recycling**, how to preserve **state** during scrolling, and best practices for dealing with dynamic user input.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multiple EditTexts in RecyclerView**: Each list item contains an EditText where users can input data.
- **Preserve Input Data**: Ensures that user input is not lost when scrolling through the RecyclerView.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Learn how RecyclerView handles the recycling of views and how to manage the state effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
RecyclerView is designed to **reuse views** to save memory, which can be challenging when dealing with **dynamic content** such as EditTexts. Without proper handling, RecyclerView may:
- Lose input data when views are recycled.
- Display wrong data when scrolling due to recycled views.

### ‚ö° Core Concepts:
- **Recycling**: As you scroll, views that go off-screen are reused for newly visible items.
- **State Preservation**: You must manually handle the state of dynamic content (e.g., text in EditTexts).
- **Stable IDs**: Ensuring each item in the RecyclerView has a unique identifier can help in preserving state.

### üõë Common Issue:
When a user inputs text in an EditText and scrolls, the text may appear in other EditTexts due to view recycling. This project tackles how to **avoid this problem**.

## üí° Solutions Implemented
1. **`getItemViewType(position)` & `setHasStableIds(true)`**: These methods are used to ensure that each item in the RecyclerView has a unique view type and ID.
   
2. **ViewHolder Pattern**: Efficient use of the ViewHolder to bind data to views and avoid unnecessary calls to `findViewById()`.

3. **Data Binding**: Sync user input with the dataset and persist the entered data during scrolls.

4. **EditText State Management**: Leveraged listeners and ViewHolder to save text data before the view is recycled.

## üîß Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-content-recyclerview.git
